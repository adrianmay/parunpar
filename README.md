There are three goals here:

1. Show how much fun functional javascript can be
2. Efficiently serialise objects you know the contents of
3. Make the name "rhaboo" sound sensible by comparison

It's not a JSON replacement. It's for when you want to control exactly 
how things are encoded, want to do that hierarchially, and want to 
write the en- and decoding code near each other for each bit of the
hierarchy.

The docs are in the source file and the test files provide examples.
